# chatApp-by-chatEngine-by-firebase
This is a simple ChatApp built with ChatEngine from Firebase.

But you can also try to use ChatEngine with other Database or Authentication System.

You just need the ChatEngine ProjectID, username, email, and secret(UUID or anynumber like I did in the /javascript-chat-engine/index.html
